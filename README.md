# Caps Lock Shift  
  
Makes it so that the caps lock key toggles shift.  
When <kbd>Caps</kbd> is pressed, the program turns off `Caps Lock` and holds <kbd>Shift</kbd> until <kbd>Caps</kbd> is pressed again.  
  
Unfortunately, because the program turns off caps lock, there is no keyboard indicator of whether the Shift Lock is on. At the moment, it's only available on the console window.  
The program does this, since when `Caps Lock` is on, shift actually undoes the capitalization that `Caps Lock` does.
